# Learning Java


## What is this repo?

This is meant to represent the notes/code written while learning the Java programming language.

It is NOT meant to be followed in any way or form, just a collection of notes and useful code.


Some of this is borrowed from the O'Reily `Learning Java, 6th Edition` and if you want to learn Java yourself I'd suggest starting there!
