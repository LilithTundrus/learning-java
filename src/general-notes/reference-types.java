/* 
In Java, you can create complex data types from the simple ones by creating a class

In Java, if you create a class titled Test, you are also implicitly making the type Test
as well. The type dictates how and where something can be used. 

a type is not just a simple attribute like some other languages. Classes can have relationships
including subclass relationships. Classes can have parent/child relationships and the child is 
considered a subtype of the parent. An object of the child type can be used in place of the parent
since it at least retains the same functionality and behavior.

Primitive types in Java are simply copied when assigned value.

Reference types on the other hand use something called pointers. When the reference is assigned to a variable or passed 
to a method, only the reference is copied, not the object to which it is pointing.

The reference itself, unlike C or C++ cannot be explicitly changed. 

An important distinction to make at this point is that the
reference itself is a value and that value is copied when it is assigned to a variable or
passed in a method call. 

Reference types always point to objects, and objects are always defined by classes. How‐
ever, two special kinds of reference types—arrays and interfaces—specify the type of
object they point to in a special way
