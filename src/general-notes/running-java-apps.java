// A standalone Java application MUST include at least one class!
// This class must have a main() method that takes an array of string as an argument

// That function always looks like this:

public static void main(String[] args) {

}

// To run an application you start the VM with the `java` command and specify the class
// that you would like to run:

// > java [java options] className [arguments]

// The class name give to the Java VM should be its FULL class path name:
// IE com.Thing.Run vs Thing.Run

// Though there are exceptions since the default class path is the current directory

// Note that you do NOT have to include the file name extension


// Additionally you can use the java command to launch JAR files the same way,
// JAR files being archived Java code/assets
